## The Problem 

[Outline of problem]  (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xEwsq84LiiHmpbS7On1YMXngnqEUJ9EmwHR-CCjF3Zc/edit#)
Often times you're recommended places to visit and things to do whether it's eating at a restaurant, reading a book, having a drink at a bar or watching a movie but with a busy schedule you tend to forget about those things and never get around to them. 

## The Solution 
An app that reminds you to do those things you were recommended by alerting you when your nearby. Espy adds the things you want to do into a list and you'll be reminded once per week to try something on your list. If you're out and about in the city and happen to be near a place that's on your list, Espy will notify you it's nearby. For example, using your home, work and school addresses and Espy will mark down the places that are near your usual route so you can try that new coffee shop instead of the usual pre-work Starbucks!

Baseline Features
  *  Customizable reminder notifications so user has control of how often they would like to be reminded to look at their list
  *  Location tracking to determine when the user is near a location
  *  Search bar to find places on your list or recommended places
  *  Firebase Database to store information for offline use, will sync automatically when internet is available
  
Bonus Features 
  *  Use Amazon API to alert users if an item on their list such as a book is on sale
  *  Implement OMDB to find movies and tv shows 
  *  Social media (twitter, instagram, facebook) to notify user's contacts of things user is doing or to find/post        recommendations etc.

## Execution

[Project Plan] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n4XtthaWqkg7YvaTfJZwC9Fc10RKd4JLr4HaUtYAh1c/edit?usp=sharing)

  *  A detailed timeline for building the product, broken out by weekly sprints. Implement the training from the [Project Management workshop](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-3/blob/master/lessons/16_ProjectManagement.md) to plan your sprints and outline which features you want to build out over the next 4 weeks. Think about the user stories you would frame your sprints around. *Projects should be planned to complete the build by Demo 1 on September 1, 2015.*  
  *  A breakdown of team member responsibilities. Team members should take ownership over a specific feature or aspect of the app.
