## The Problem 
Often times you're recommended places to visit and things to do whether it's eating at a restaurant, reading a book, having a drink at a bar or watching a movie but with a busy schedule you tend to forget about those things and never get around to them. It would be nice if you had a tool that would remind you to do those things. Espy is the tool for this problem. Add the things you want to do into your Espy list and you'll be reminded once per week to try something on your list. If you're out and about in the city and happen to be near a place that's on your list, Espy will notify you it's nearby. Enter your home, work and school address and Espy will mark down the places that are near your usual route so you can try that new coffee shop instead of the usual pre-work Starbucks!

In this section, please frame the issue with supporting statistics about the need (market size, competitors, use cases). You should fully think through your user - who is your user? Why do they need this app? How are they using it?   

## The Solution 
Please provide a detailed description of the app here. Map out how the app solves the problem described in section I. You should also include:
  *  Baseline features you plan to implement by Demo 1 (what + why).
  *  Bonus features you plan to implement if baseline features are completed in time (what + why).
  *  A wireframe of the app. 

## Execution
Please describe how you will build this app. Include: 
  *  A detailed timeline for building the product, broken out by weekly sprints. Implement the training from the [Project Management workshop](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-3/blob/master/lessons/16_ProjectManagement.md) to plan your sprints and outline which features you want to build out over the next 4 weeks. Think about the user stories you would frame your sprints around. *Projects should be planned to complete the build by Demo 1 on September 1, 2015.*  
  *  A breakdown of team member responsibilities. Team members should take ownership over a specific feature or aspect of the app.
